About me
===
 I am a Computer-Science Ph.D. candidate at [Bar-Ilan University](https://www1.biu.ac.il/) under the supervision of [Prof. Joseph Keshet](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~jkeshet/).\
  My research interests are in machine-learning and deep-learning â€”specifically, the security of algorithms, their interpretability, and applications in the domain of speech.
