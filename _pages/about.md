About me
===
 I am a Ph.D. candidate at the faculty of Eatctrical & Computer Engineering of the Technion under the supervision of [Prof. Joseph Keshet](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~jkeshet/).\
  My research interests are in machine learning and deep learning, specifically in their applications to speech processing and recognition. Recently, I have been working on handling out-of-distribution signals and utilizing represenation of self-supervised learning models for different applications.
